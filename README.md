# stm32-bluepill-ky-sensors
My project demonstrating how to interface the STM32 Blue Pill (STM32F103C8T6) with KY series sensors. Includes circuit diagrams and source code for connecting and reading data from various KY modules. Useful for learning microcontroller sensor interfacing and building sensor projects.
